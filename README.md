# I don't know C++
So here's my attempt at learning this old, weird, ubiquitously necessary language.

## Do you know C++?
Then please peruse the repository and point out things I've done wrong. That includes conventions that I'm not following. I've never used this language before. I'm just good at programming in general. I started in Java and got really good at that, but I do know pointers.

### "No that's too much work"
Fine. At least look at the next section and see if you can spare a few moments to answer some general questions I have. You'll see those there.

## Stuff I'm trying to figure out
* What's the convention for #include header files? Do you make one header for every .cpp file and put any dependency headers there? Or do they just go wherever you want?

## Tech Stack:
* Netbeans IDE with C++ plugin
* Cygwin toolchain (GCC, G++, Make, and the gang)
* Git (duh)
